Story: transfer to cash account
  As a savings account holder
  I want to transfer money from my savings account
  So that I can get cash easily from an ATM

  Scenario: savings account is in credit
    Given my savings account balance is '100'
    And my cash account balance is '10'
    When I transfer '20'
    Then my savings account balance should be '80'

  Scenario: savings account is overdrawn
    Given my savings account balance is '-20'
    And my cash account balance is '10'
    When I transfer '20'
    Then my savings account balance should be '-40'
